# Module 3: Edge AI & Robotics Hardware

In this module, we explore the physical backbone of humanoid robotics. You’ll learn how to select, configure, and conceptualize deployment of Edge AI kits, sensors, and robots.

## Recommended Workstations
## Digital Twin Rig

**GPU:** NVIDIA RTX series (VRAM is critical for Isaac Sim & sensor simulation)

**CPU:** High-core modern generation processors

**RAM:** 32–64 GB for smooth simulation

**OS:** Ubuntu LTS (Linux-native ROS 2 support)

## Edge AI Kits (Jetson Orin)

Deploy ROS 2 nodes for **real-time inference** and sensor processing.

Essential peripherals: **Intel RealSense cameras**, USB microphone arrays, SD cards, and power modules.

Focus: balancing compute capability, power consumption, and mobility.

## Robot Lab Approaches

**Proxy Robots:**  Quadrupeds or robotic arms to safely test humanoid algorithms.

**Miniature Humanoids:** Tabletop robots for kinematics and locomotion demos.

**Premium Humanoids:** Full-size units for sim-to-real deployment and final projects.

## Budgeting & Hardware Planning

Document hardware choices, approximate costs, and tradeoffs.
Plan minimum specs required for simulation, Edge AI deployment, and integration with sensors.
Consider scalability for team-based or classroom settings.

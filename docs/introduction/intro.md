# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

Welcome to the *Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics* textbook — a hands-on, project-focused course designed to teach you how to build, simulate, and control humanoid robots using state-of-the-art AI techniques.

This textbook includes:

- **ROS 2:** Building the robotic nervous system, nodes, topics, services  
- **Simulation (Gazebo & Unity):** Digital twin creation, physics, and sensor simulation  
- **NVIDIA Isaac Sim & Isaac ROS:** AI-driven perception, navigation, and manipulation  
- **Vision-Language-Action (VLA):** Integrating LLMs for autonomous robot actions  
- **Edge AI & Hardware:** Jetson kits, RealSense cameras, IMUs, and microphones  
- **Humanoid Robotics:** Kinematics, bipedal locomotion, grasping, and natural interaction  
- **Capstone Project:** Design and deploy an autonomous humanoid robot  

Navigate the sidebar for modules. Each module provides theory, conceptual diagrams, design patterns, and guided lab procedures for practical learning and demonstrations.

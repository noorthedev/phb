# Glossary

**ROS 2:** Robot Operating System 2 — middleware that connects software agents to robot hardware.

**URDF:** Unified Robot Description Format — XML-based robot modeling format.

**Xacro:** XML macros for generating modular and reusable URDFs.

**DDS:** Data Distribution Service — ensures reliable, real-time communication between ROS 2 nodes.

**VLA:** Vision-Language-Action — architecture for multimodal perception, reasoning, and actuation in robots.

**Sim-to-Real:** The process of transferring models or controllers from simulation to physical robots.

**Jetson:** NVIDIA embedded edge AI devices for running robot perception and control pipelines.

**Gait Cycle:** Sequence of movements a humanoid leg undergoes during walking.

**ZMP (Zero Moment Point):** A point on the ground where the total moment due to gravity and inertia is zero, used to measure stability.

**CoM (Center of Mass):** The average location of mass in a robot, crucial for balance.

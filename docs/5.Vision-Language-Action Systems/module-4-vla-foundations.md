# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action Systems

## From Perception to Action

VLA systems empower humanoids to perceive, comprehend, and act. In this module, you’ll explore the architecture, model selection, and conceptual deployment patterns — all presented as design guidelines and illustrative diagrams.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

Identify the core components of a VLA system and their interactions.

Draft multimodal pipelines: sensors → perception → LLM planner → action generator.

Outline evaluation metrics for perception accuracy and action success.

Recognize ethical, safety, and human-centric considerations in VLA design.

## Conceptual Design Patterns

**Multimodal Fusion:** Combine visual and language features for planning and reasoning.

**Closed-Loop Perception-Planning-Action:** Visualize continuous feedback cycles.

**Safety & Override Channels:** Integrate conceptual human-in-the-loop checks.

⚠️ Note: This module focuses on design and architecture. Implementation code is provided in Appendix → Resources for reference.

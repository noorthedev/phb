## anguage in VLA

Language topics (conceptual):

Parsing commands using intent-slot frameworks.

Role of LLMs as planners vs rule-based planners.

Handling ambiguity, confirmation, and safety checks.

## Design Notes

Decide if the LLM runs locally (small models) or remotely (cloud).

Define fallbacks and human-in-the-loop policies for critical commands.

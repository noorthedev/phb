# Vision in VLA

Vision topics (conceptual):

**•** Object detection and segmentation approaches.

**•** Depth sensing and point-cloud handling.

**•** Guidelines for synthetic data generation and dataset curation.

## Evaluation & Metrics

**•** Precision, recall, IoU for segmentation tasks.

**•** Latency and throughput limits for real-time edge perception.

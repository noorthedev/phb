# Module 2: Digital Twins & Simulation

Simulation acts as the virtual bridge between design and reality. In this module, you will conceptually build, test, and validate humanoid robots in virtual environments.

## What You’ll Learn

Set up Gazebo to model and test URDF/SDF robots safely.

Use Unity for high-fidelity rendering, interactive human-robot interaction, and visual validation.

Simulate sensors such as cameras, LiDAR, IMUs, and contact sensors.

Plan synthetic datasets for AI perception and control training.

## Hands-On Conceptual Activities

Environment Design Checklist: Plan lighting, textures, physics parameters, and collision properties.

Dataset Planning: Define object types, positions, lighting variations, and annotation schema for training AI models.

Sim-to-Real Preparation: List domain randomization parameters, system identification variables, and steps to validate before deployment.
